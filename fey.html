            <p>I have a dog named Fey. Fey means fairy. She’s not very fairy-like though. She's a funny and cuute dog. I got her after I moved to Clovis. She’s about 10 years old now. She likes going on walks and eating a lot. When we go on walks she starts out really fast, but she gets really slow after 10-15 minutes. She doesn’t really like other dogs, but if she sniffs them for a while she’ll get used to them and calm down. She’s afraid of balls, so we don’t play catch with her. When we watch horror movies she gets scared. When my mom is feeding Fey and she says no more in Hmong, Fey understands.
