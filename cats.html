            <p>We got Pip and Kai in the summer of 2022. Pip is a boy and Kai is a girl. They are both siblings. They like to scratch our furniture and carpet. They like to climb the tree in our backyard, and sometimes they fall. Pip likes coming into my room and laying on my bed, and Kai likes going into my sister’s. They like to go on my sister’s balcony a lot. They like to go outside and then come back in after 5 minutes. When Pip wants to come back in the house, he jumps up and down. They like to play with their toys and catch bugs. They like to sit at the top of the stairs, and when they see us coming they run down.
